                        <p>I received my associates in general studies 19 years ago, but the following year we had the 1st of our 4 children and I have been a stay at home mom ever since...putting school on the back burner. Now that my youngest is in Elementary School I am looking to get back into the workforce and learning Web Development sounded like a good fit.</p>
                        <p>I was born in California and lived in Hawaii for my first year before heading back to California. When I was 6 years old my family moved to Utah where I spent the remainder of my childhood. I was a competitive gymnast until I was 16, then in High School I played tennis. I met my husband just before my 19th birthday and we married 8 months later.</p>
                        <p>In my free time I love to go to the gym and spend time with my kids. My hubby and I are pretty much concert junkies...there really is nothing like live music! We both have very eclectic taste, so it makes it hard not to go to every concert that comes to town. I love photography and enjoy digital scrapbooking/photo editing when I have the time. I also enjoy pretty much anything outdoors including hiking, camping, boating, sports and four wheeling.</p>
